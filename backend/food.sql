(yes this means i kept a can opener and a blender alongside a loaf of bread in my locker at work, but i had good, filling lunches and snacks all the time with very little prep or planning involved which worked super well for me! no leaving the office to beat traffic to grab fast food or expensive doordashing.)  if you like raw produce, hummus or salsa are also good dipping alternatives, and can be eaten with crackers or tortilla chips too. hummus comes in a bunch of flavors now too, so you can have a variety to alternate with.');
